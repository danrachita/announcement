Official sites of many crytocurrency were closed. We will soon be sharing information, analyzed through git. It seems like most of the operating expenses have been exceeded. These crytocurrencies will be growed on by their holder. Robin project opened discord account. Robin project is very busy and may not be able to get involved often. We hope that it will be used as a good space for community people.

Since the official github service of alanis, zmining, wilo, ximant, genero is closed, Robin project shared the data for community. Robin project will continue to study cryptocurrency platform,  mobile wallet, network gateway, IOT market. We hope many POS cryptocurrencies will be used well.

Robin project has updated alanis, blazarium, lunique, ximant, zenad blockchain bootstrap. Recently, blockchain scamming rate of proof-of-stake crytocurrency has been increasing. It seems to be due to increase of new ico coins. Masternode should be increased, and it is advisable to increase coin holdings for staking. And we recommend running on a stable network masternode and staking server. The worse the network, the higher the scamming rate. Thank you.

Our utum service has been terminated. Since the service is already being performed by the other party, the service is terminated in order to eliminate confusion

We fixed zenad scammed blockchain. To reduce the blockchain scamming rate, it is best to increase the number of "addnode=xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx" in '.conf' configuration file or increase the number of ximant, zenad nodes. Not all of the blockchain are scammed with malicious intent. If transaction confirmation is not complete due to insufficient number of nodes, or if the network is delayed and the blockchain synchronization is not performed well, the transaction ID with the already generated block may be branched into the scamming blockchain. The node manager, the staking manager, and the core wallet user must shutdown coin deamon and reindex it with the fixed blockchain bootstrap when it becomes a scamming blockchain.

blazarium, utum are currently no official github, no website, no explorer site. And also no discord, twitter, or telegram community. Robin project will manage only on github. The current exchange is only traded on Graviex.net. At first they are exist. But they closed their services in own office. However, there are many nodes and staking operators. And there are still coin holders. For them, Robin project will continue to serve on github.
